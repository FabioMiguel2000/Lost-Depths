  lore: "2156-07-21\n\nMonths have passed since we set out on our mission to make
    contact with the distant planet. We have labored tirelessly, developing advanced
    technology to transmit our own messages across the vast cosmic expanse. The anticipation
    builds within us as we send our signals into the depths, hoping they reach their
    intended destination. \n\nWill the inhabitants of the distant planet receive
    our messages? Will they respond to our call for connection? We await their reply,
    filled with anticipation and wonder."
