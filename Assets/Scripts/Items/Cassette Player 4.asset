  lore: "2157-06-19\n\nThe situation has become dire, and our hopes wane like the
    fading light in the deep sea. Our scientists have exhausted every known method
    to reverse the toxic encroachment on our waters. \n\nWe face the grim reality
    that our survival is at stake. In this time of desperation, we reach out to the
    inhabitants of a distant planet, our unknown allies. We implore them to listen
    and comprehend the urgency of our plea. We believe they hold the key to our salvation."
