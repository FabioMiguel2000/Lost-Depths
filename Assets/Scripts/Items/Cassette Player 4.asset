  lore: "Chapter 4: A Desperate Call\n\n2157-06-19\n\nThe situation has become dire,
    and our hopes wane like the fading light in the deep sea. Our scientists have
    exhausted every known method to reverse the toxic encroachment on our waters.
    \n\nWe face the grim reality that our survival is at stake. In this time of desperation,
    we reach out to the inhabitants of a distant planet, our unknown allies. We implore
    them to listen and comprehend the urgency of our plea. We believe they hold the
    key to our salvation."
