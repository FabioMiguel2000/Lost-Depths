  lore: "2157-11-02\n\nOur relentless research reveals a tragic revelation. The toxic
    transformation of our waters is not a result of natural forces but rather an
    insidious cosmic storm of particles, unseen and misunderstood until now. These
    particles infiltrate the very molecules of our water, altering their properties
    and rendering them poisonous to our kind. \n\nOur hearts ache as we realize the
    enormity of our fate. We send this message as a warning, not just for our own
    world but for all others. The storm will traverse the cosmos, sparing no one
    in its path. The fabric of existence itself seems threatened."
