  lore: "Chapter 5: The Tragedy Unveiled\n\n2157-11-02\n\nOur relentless research
    reveals a tragic revelation. The toxic transformation of our waters is not a
    result of natural forces but rather an insidious cosmic storm of particles, unseen
    and misunderstood until now. These particles infiltrate the very molecules of
    our water, altering their properties and rendering them poisonous to our kind.
    \n\nOur hearts ache as we realize the enormity of our fate. We send this message
    as a warning, not just for our own world but for all others. The storm will traverse
    the cosmos, sparing no one in its path. The fabric of existence itself seems
    threatened."
